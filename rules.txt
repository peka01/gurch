Here is a summary of the rules I have understood so far:

**Objective:**
*   Be the first to get rid of all your cards. The player who finishes with the lowest value card(s) on their last play wins the pot.

**Gameplay:**
*   A player starts a round by playing one or more cards of the same rank (e.g., two Kings).
*   Other players must play the same number of cards of an equal or higher rank (e.g., two Kings or two Aces).
*   If a player cannot play a valid set of cards, they must discard their lowest card(s). The number of cards discarded must match the number of cards led in the round.
*   The player who played the highest-ranking cards wins the round and starts the next one.
*   If multiple players play the same highest rank, the last one to play wins.
*   If no one can beat the lead cards, the original player who started the round plays again.

**Scoring:**
*   Scoring is based on the cards played in the final round (when a player goes out).
*   The player who went out with the lowest total card value wins.
*   The winner's prize is the total value of the cards held by the player with the *highest* total value in that final round.
*   Card values are 2-10 for number cards, Jack=11, Queen=12, King=13, Ace=14.
*   There are different rooms with multipliers (1x to 10x) that affect the final winnings.

**Tie-breaker ("Minigame"):**
*   If there's a tie for the lowest (winner) or highest (score), the tied players enter a minigame.
*   Each is dealt 3 cards. They can keep them or swap for a new set of 3.
*   A new round is played among these players to determine the final winner/loser.
